# Hey there <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1531849430/4246/blob-sunglasses.gif?1531849430" width="30"/>!

I'm **Alberto Tudela**, robotics researcher from Spain, currently working in the Department of Electronic Technology (DTE) at [Universidad de M√°laga](https://www.uma.es/).

My passion for robotics has driven my line of research, which focuses on the development of perceptive agents that can accurately monitor and analyze the state of the world. Additionally, I am actively involved in the creation of social navigation algorithms, which are carefully integrated into the cognitive architectures of social assistive robots. This research has the potential to revolutionize the field of robotics, providing novel ways for robots to interact with and assist humans in their daily lives.

In addition to my work in robotics, I'm also a member of [Astromech Spain](https://www.astromechspain.com/), the largest community of Star Wars‚Ñ¢ droid builders in Spain. This collaborative group is dedicated to building faithful replicas of droid units from the Star Wars film series, allowing me to hone my creativity and attention to detail.
